Welcome to the first edition of the textbook for STAT 1300! This is a new class, so there are likely to be several changes and updates over the course of the first few iterations of the class.

Below is a summary of the items we will cover in the book:

* Understand data structures (observations, variables), as well as types of variables (quantitative, qualitative).

* Read in and summarize data in different formats (.csv, .xlsx, from a website)

* Create graphical summaries of variables

* Create and explain the properties of a linear regression model

* Understand and run classification, both supervised and unsupervised, for a simple data set

* Discuss ethical issues surrounding classification methods
